# dbt Hands-On Project

This repository is a hands-on project to explore **dbt (Data Build Tool)** and its functionalities. The goal is to build a data pipeline with transformation, testing, and documentation using dbt. This project provides a simple setup for learning and experimenting with dbt's core capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project covers:
- **Data Modeling**: Transform raw data into analytics-ready tables.
- **Testing**: Ensure data quality with built-in and custom dbt tests.
- **Documentation**: Generate and explore data pipeline documentation.
- **Incremental Models**: Learn how to implement and manage incremental loads.
- **Macros**: Use Jinja and dbt macros for reusable SQL transformations.


### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
